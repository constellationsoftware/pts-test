[Lorenzo Guddemi][1] is a professional audio engineer at [Mathlab Recording Studio][2] and a founding partner at Fiat Lux & Constellation. All our shows are edited, mixed & engineered by Lorenzo, and even though he's behind the scenes most of the time, his role is incredibly important to what we do and our plans moving forward.

Recorded just a few days before launching the new site, Lorenzo and Ben talk about how he became an audio engineer, what he's doing at Fiat Lux / Constellation, why podcasting is an art, and how rapidly things (and people) can change.


##[02:00](#play){.chapter} How Lorenzo got started working in audio.

Lorenzo had been playing bass since he was 14, and in his early twenties went to a studio to mix his band's record. Now he's working at the same studio as a professional audio engineer.

## [24:00](#play){.chapter} Is it a hobby or is it art?

Ben and Lorenzo discuss why podcasting is a lot like being in a band. Being successful may not mean much in the way of money (for most of us) but people still put in tons of effort and time and money. Ben doesn't think hobby is the right word for that. 

## [33:30](#play){.chapter} I can handle that.

Lorenzo explains why he decided to take on mixing, editing & post-production for podcasters, and Ben explains the process in giving up control to a partner.

## [44:30](#play){.chapter} Everything just falls into place, and it shouldn't be possible.

Lorenzo asks a serious question, one that doesn't have a clear answer.
